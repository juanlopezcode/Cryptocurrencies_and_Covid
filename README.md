# Cryptocurrencies_and_Covid
Cryptocurrencies and Covid-19 analysis with Python and Spark 

Data requested on notebook from different sources. Feel free to run the notebook with updated values.

The main goals to achieve from this work are firstly, see and
analyse what happened between cryptocurrencies prices and
the total and new covid cases registered world-wide since the
first day of pandemic, and with this find the kind of correlation
between them.

Secondly, with an analysis of users opinions on the assets
from online posts, being them positives or negatives, find what
kind of correlation exists between their sentiment and the
current price. With this, determine if a sentiment analysis is
enough and strong information for trading as a user perspective. 

Thirdly, grouping variables from Covid-19 dataset in a
way which insights can be discovered or confirmed related
with the disease.
