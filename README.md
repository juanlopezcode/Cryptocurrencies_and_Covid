Cryptocurrencies and Covid-19 analysis with Python and Spark 



Considered one of the most important topics world-wide on 2020 and at this point the beginning of 2021 is
the Covid-19, disease that was officially ranked as pandemic on March 11, 2020. Its presence, has led to change almost

safeguards on specific assets due the presence of the disease, as a complement from social media a sentiment analysis
was performed from these assets in order to examined mood and feelings relation to prices/trade. Also, from the health
domain, has been made an approach of data mining analysis with clusters for the purpose of data exploration and insights
discoveries. All this work done with the help of Big data technologies due the large requirements of data handling and
processing.

The main goals to achieve from this work are firstly, see and
analyse what happened between cryptocurrencies prices and
the total and new covid cases registered world-wide since the
first day of pandemic, and with this find the kind of correlation
between them.

current price. With this, determine if a sentiment analysis is
enough and strong information for trading as a user perspective. 

Thirdly, grouping variables from Covid-19 dataset in a
